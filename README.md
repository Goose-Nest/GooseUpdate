# GooseUpdate

A HTTP server which replicates Discord's update API, proxying requests to the official endpoint and allows custom versions of modules.

# Deploying
1. Install GooseUpdate's dependencies with `npm install`
2. Copy `example.config.js` to `config.js` and modify it to your liking, then run `node src/index.js (PORT)`.

# Usage
Discord fetches the update API URL from a `settings.json` file stored in various directories depending on your operating system.

Said directories are found below:
* Windows:
  * `%appdata%\discord<channel>\`
* Mac:
  * `~/Library/Application Support/discord<channel>/`
* Linux:
  * Package Manager/tar.gz Installation: `~/.config/discord<channel>/`
  * Flatpak: `~/.var/app/com.discordapp.Discord/config/discord<channel>/settings.json`

Set `UPDATE_ENDPOINT` and `NEW_UPDATE_ENDPOINT` in `settings.json` as follows:

```json
"UPDATE_ENDPOINT": "https://<GooseUpdate instance URL>/branch"
"NEW_UPDATE_ENDPOINT": "https://<GooseUpdate instance URL>/branch/"
```

GooseUpdate also supports including multiple branches in updates by separating their names with a `+`, like `https://<GooseUpdate instance URL>/branch1+branch2`.

# Adding a branch
GooseUpdate branches patch `discord_desktop_core` with files stored in `branches/<branch name>/`.

Branches must have a `patch.js` file to handle their injection in their branch directory, which is prepended to Discord's base `index.js` of the module.

```javascript
// Any code you want to inject goes here
require('mod.js')
```

If other files are in the branch directory, they will be added the module directory.
